## Get started

### Prerequisites

To use this extension you will need to install:

1. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (version 1.35 or higher).
2. The extension. There are two possibilities:
   - From the [Visual Studio Code marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Esri.arcgis-maps-sdk-js-snippets).
   - Using the **_[Install from VSIX](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_install-from-a-vsix)_** command in Visual Studio Code then import the [arcgis-jsapi-snippets-1.1.0.vsix](./arcgis-jsapi-snippets-1.1.0.vsix) file.

### Usage

After installing, there are two ways to use it:

**Option 1**) Using [built-in VS Code Intellisense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/javascript#_intellisense):

1. Create an empty project with an empty `index.js` file.
2. Start typing one the prefix of one the [available code snippets](#snippets-available). (e.g. `elev`).
3. Select the snippet by pressing `Tab` or `Enter` key.
4. If there are values highlighted in gray, you can move between them using `Tab` (forward) and `Shift+Tab` (backwards).

> **Troubleshooting:**<br>
> If the Intellisense doesn't work:
>
> - Make sure to have `"editor.tabCompletion": "on"` in the settings (`Preferences` > `Open Settings(JSON)`)
> - If pressing Tab doesn't work then you might have several snippets with the same prefix. Press `Ctrl-Space` (`Cmd-Space` on mac) to select the one you need.
>
> Read more about this feature in the official [VSCode documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets).

**Option 2**) Installing the [Snippet Viewer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RandomFractalsInc.snippets-viewer) extension

This extension adds a new option to the activity bar that lets you quickly browse and insert built-in and custom snippets:
